# Machine-Learning-Projects
Here are the Machine Learning Projects on which I have worked on, have a look..
	Adult Salary Prediction
	The data file consists data of adults working class in the US which is to be analyzed based on    various factors and categories based upon which the data is collected.
	Machine learning model is to be prepared to predict the ranges of salaries of working class.
	Since the data of salary is binary classified, I have tried developing a Machine learning model using Logistic Regression Algorithm.
	Model is able to accurately classify the ranges of salaries  for 83.561% of time.
	Telecom customer churn rate prediction
	The data set consists of telecom customer data collected based on various factors associated to Telecom business, which is to be analyzed and predict the churn rate of customers.
	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA- Visual and Statistical) was performed to analyze relation of various parameters impacting business and get insight to find reasons of churning.
	Machine learning model was developed using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier.
	The both models giving accuracy of 80.51% and 76.60%.
	Car Price Perdition 
	The dataset consists of Audi car collected based on various components and functions impacting the price of car. Considering all that car price is to be predicted.
	Machine learning models based on various algorithms like  Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor were used.
	The models were able to predict the price correctly for 87.10%, 89.82%, & 92.38% of times respectively.
	SMS classification project
	The data set consists of text data which contains ham and spam SMS. A model is to prepared to predict whether the received message is spam or ham.
	Naive Bayes classifier algorithm is sued to develop a model, which was able to predict the SMS classification for 97.93% of times correctly.
	Libraries: Numpy, Panads, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK.
	Credit Card Fraud Detection
	The data of credit card transaction was to be analyzed in order to detect the fraudulent transactions.
	Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regressor were used.
	Model were able to correctly predict the transaction 99% of times in both cases. Since the data for fraud transactions  was too less.
	Board Game Review Prediction
	The dataset consists of various games where they have been reviewed based upon various factors of games by the users.
	A machine learning model was developed here using Logistic Regression and , Random Forest Regressor which could predict the review for different board games board game based on similar factors.
